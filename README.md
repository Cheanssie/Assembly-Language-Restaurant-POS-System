## User Authentication: 
The system starts with a user authentication module where staff and customers can log in with their respective credentials. Staff can access administrative functions, while customers can enjoy personalized services based on their membership status.

## Membership Services: 
The system offers a membership module that allows customers to register or renew their memberships. Depending on their membership level, customers can avail themselves of various discounts and special offers.

## Ordering System: 
The heart of the system lies in its ordering capabilities. Customers can place orders for dine-in, take-away, or delivery. The system calculates the total amount, including taxes and delivery charges, providing customers with accurate billing information.

## Menu Management: 
The system efficiently organizes the restaurant's menu, categorizing items into food and beverage sections. The staff can easily adjust product prices, add new items, and remove discontinued ones, ensuring the menu stays up-to-date.

## Stock Management: 
The system includes a stock management module, allowing staff to view current stock levels, restock products, and update stock prices. The program will automatically deduct the restocking cost from the daily summary report to track net earnings accurately.

## Sales and Expenses Reports: 
The system generates detailed Daily Summary Sales and Expenses Reports. These reports provide insights into daily earnings, expenses, best-selling items, restocking quantities, and other essential metrics for informed decision-making.
